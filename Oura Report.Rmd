## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load csv and packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <- read.csv(file.choose()) # load csv of choice

library(lubridate) # load lubridate for working with dates
library(dplyr) # dplyr for manipulated data
library(ggplot2) # for visualizations
library(rmarkdown) # to create report
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
